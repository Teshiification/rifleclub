This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server with turbo:

```bash
npm run dev --turbo
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Next, run pocketbase to grant access to the database:

```bash
./pocketbase serve
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8090/\_/](http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/) with your browser to access the Admin UI.

## Deploy on Vercel
